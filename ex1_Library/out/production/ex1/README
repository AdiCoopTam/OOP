In general, I used the API that I've got.
I want to explain a template I used in Library class.
I created an arrays to document the data in the library -
bookLst, to store the data about the books the library have;
patronLst, to store the data about the patrons that registered to the library;
patronEnjoymentThreshold, to store the data about how many books every patron already borrowd.

Another interesting method I had was the indexing method. I chose to associate the ID of the book or patron
with his index in the array. That way, it was easy to approach to the data about the object (for example,
checking if a book is borrowed or not).

I hope you'll enjoy checking my code. Anyway, Wabba-Daba-Dub-Dub!
