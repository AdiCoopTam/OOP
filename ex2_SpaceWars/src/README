SpaceShip.java - implements the SpaceShip class.
SpaceShipFactory - implements the ships creator class.
ActionZone.java - implements the operation zone for SpaceShip class.

=============================
In general, I used the API that I've got.
I added "update Energy" function, that justify the energy level doesn't pass the max energy level.

Let's talk about the Drunk and Special types I created -

The Drunk type has fall asleep on the control panel, therefore he moves randomly to all the directions and
accelerate or not randomly. He will try to teleport and will shoot or put a shield on based on a random
parameters.

The Special type is characterize by changing his behave every few round. He will be a Basher, an Aggressive, a
 Runner - and will even mimic the Human player... Is'nt that creepy?

Now, I want to discuss the ActiveZone class.
when I looked at my coding mission, I thought I'll have a lot of repetitive motives on the action part. Most
of the SpaceShip objects are interested at the same information, such as the closest SpaceShip and the angle
to her. Therefor, I created an whole class that implements the operation system.

I hope you'll enjoy checking my code. Anyway, Wabba-Daba-Dub-Dub!
